# DiabeTech
The project is a tensorflow model to predict the next value of sugar in the blood of patients with diabetes. It is based on a data set of 70 people which measured daily their level of glucose, the doses of insuline used, and activities done during the day.

Work in progress

## Requirements

To work correctly, the following programs/libraries are needed:
* Python 3.5
* Numpy
* Tensorflow
* matplotlib

The functionality of the model is not guaranteed for older or newer versions.

## Install

    pip install --upgrade numpy
    pip install --upgrade tensorflow
    pip install matplotlib
  
## Running

The order to run the program is:
* "dataset normalizer.py"
* "dataser cleaner.py"
* "visualization.py"
* "make_it_small.py"
* "model1.py"

In alternative, you can run the scripts contained in the folder 'Scripts' following the instruction described in the correspondent documentaion.
