Diabetes patient records were obtained from two sources:  an automatic
electronic recording device and paper records.  The automatic device
had an internal clock to timestamp events, whereas the paper records
only provided "logical time" slots (breakfast, lunch, dinner,
bedtime).  For paper records, fixed times were assigned to breakfast
(08:00), lunch (12:00), dinner (18:00), and bedtime (22:00).  Thus
paper records have fictitious uniform recording times whereas
electronic records have more realistic time stamps.

Diabetes files consist of four fields per record.  Each field is
separated by a tab and each record is separated by a newline.

File Names and format:
(1) User
(2) Date in MM-DD-YYYY format
(3) Time in XX:YY format
(4) normal insulin dose
(5) UltraLente insulin dose
(6) Other
(7) Pre-meal

(a) Hypoglycemic symptoms
(b) Typical meal
(c) Large meal
(d) Small meal
(e) Typical exercise
(f) Heavy exercise
(g) Light exercise


Questions regarding the format of the diabetes data files can be sent
to kahn@informatics.WUSTL.EDU (Internet) or 70333,34 (CompuServe).  Be
forwarned, I'm not very good at remembering to check Compuserve.
